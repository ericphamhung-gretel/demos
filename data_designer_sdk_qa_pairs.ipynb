You are not required to resolve your claim through mediation or arbitration. You may decline our request to resolve a claim through mediation or arbitration. You may elect to resolve your claim through litigation.\\n\\nMediation\\n\\nIf you elect to resolve your claim through mediation, a neutral mediator will help resolve the claim. The mediator does not decide the claim but helps parties reach agreement. Before beginning mediation, you or we must first send a claim notice. Within 30 days after sending or receiving a claim notice, you or we may submit the claim to JAMS (1-800-352-5267, jamsadr.com) or the American Arbitration Association (\\\"AAA\\\") (1-800-778-7879, adr.org)\\n\\nfor mediation. We will pay the fees of the mediator. All mediation-related communications are confidential, inadmissible in court and not subject to discovery. All applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled until termination of the mediation. Either you or we may terminate the mediation at any time. The submission or failure to submit a claim to mediation will not affect your or our right to elect litigation or arbitration. The outcome of mediation proceedings is non-binding. You may proceed to litigation or arbitration regardless of the outcome of mediation.\\n\\nArbitration\\n\\nYou may elect, but are not required, to resolve any claim by individual arbitration. We may also request to resolve any claim by individual arbitration, but you are not required to accept our request. Claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator.\\n\\nIf you elect or agree to resolve a claim through arbitration, your or our right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim may be limited. Further, you and we may not have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is more limited. The arbitrator's decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. Except as set forth below, the arbitrator's decision will be final and binding. Other rights you or we would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.\\n\\nInitiating Arbitration\\n\\nIf you and we agree to proceed to arbitration, claims will be referred to either JAMS or AAA, as selected by the party electing arbitration. Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration provision and the selected organization's rules in effect when the claim is filed, except where those rules conflict with these Terms & Conditions. If we choose the organization, you may select the other within 30 days after receiving notice of our selection. Contact JAMS or AAA to begin an arbitration or for other information. Claims also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and we agree in writing or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA). We will not request arbitration for any claim you file in small claims court, so long as the claim is individual and pending only in that court. You may otherwise elect to arbitrate any claim at any time unless it has been filed in court and trial has begun or final judgment has been entered.\\n\\n11\\n\\nLimitation on Arbitration\\n\\nArbitration Fees and Costs\",\n          \"arbitration organization and all parties in writing within 35 days after the arbitrator's award is issued. The arbitration organization will appoint a three-arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to. The appeal will otherwise proceed pursuant to the arbitration organization's appellate rules. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. At your election, arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.\\n\\nArbitration Fees and Costs\\n\\nYou will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in court.

In the event Customer Service is unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, this section explains how claims can be resolved through litigation, non-binding mediation or, at your election, arbitration. You are not required to resolve any claims by mediation and arbitration. For this section, you and us includes any corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related\\n\\n10\\n\\npersons or entities. Claim means any current or future claim, dispute or controversy relating to your participation in the program, these Terms & Conditions, or any prior program agreement, except for the validity, enforceability or scope of the Arbitration provision. Claim includes but is not limited to:\\n\\n1. Initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third- party claims;\\n\\n2. Claims based upon contract, tort, fraud, statute, regulation, common law and equity;\\n\\n3.

Go to americanexpress.com/claim for a sample claim notice. The claim notice should describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded. We may also request that we resolve a claim by mediation or arbitration, but you are not required to accept our request.\\n\\nWe may include our request with your billing statement or mail it to your home address. Notice to us should include your name, address and Account number and be sent to:\\n\\nAmerican Express ADR c/o CT Corporation System, 28 Liberty St NY, NY 10005\",\n          \"11\\n\\nLimitation on Arbitration\\n\\nArbitration Fees and Costs\\n\\nIf the parties agree to resolve a claim by arbitration, that claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to that agreement, and the agreement would not allow claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other Card Members or other persons similarly situated. The arbitrator's authority is limited to claims between you and us alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless you and we agree in writing. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award. Notwithstanding any other provision and without waiving the right to appeal such decision, if any portion of these Limitations on Arbitration provisions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration provision (other than this sentence) will not apply.\\n\\nYou will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in court. We will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees.\\n\\nAt your written request, we will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.\\n\\nAdditional Arbitration Awards\\n\\nIf the arbitrator rules in your favor for an amount greater than any final offer we made before arbitration, the arbitrator's award will include:\\n\\n1. Any money to which you are entitled, but in nocase less than $5,000; and\\n\\nArbitration Procedures\\n\\n2. Any reasonable attorneys' fees, costs andexpert and other witness fees.\\n\\nThis Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, statutes of limitations and privileges. The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery. Subject to the Limitations on Arbitration provisions, the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court. The arbitration will be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your claim.\\n\\nContinuation\\n\\nThis section will survive termination of the program or your participation in it. If any portion of this Claims Resolution section, except as otherwise provided in the Limitations on Arbitration subsection, is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this Claims Resolution section.\\n\\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in person hearing. At any party's request, the arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have 30 days to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing. The organization will appoint a three arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. At your election, arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.\\n\\nQuestions?\\n\\nIf you have questions about anything in these Terms and Conditions, call us at 1-800-AXP-EARN (1-800-297-3276)\\n\\n12\\n\\nCompare Products\\n\\nThe table below shows the American Express products that are eligible to participate in the Rewards Program.

Please consult your tax advisor if you have questions about the tax treatment of earning or using points.\\n\\nPoints don\\'t belong to you and are not your property. You can\\'t transfer them to someone else\\'s Rewards Account, you can\\'t sell them, and you can\\'t pass them on as part of a legal action, such as a divorce, an inheritance or bankruptcy. • The value of points varies according to how you\\n\\nchoose to use them.

If you also have a Checking Account, please make sure you read this section as well as \\'Program Terms & Conditions for Checking Accounts\\'.\\n\\nEarn Points\\n\\nConditions for earning points:\\n\\nCard Members will earn one point for every dollar of spend on an eligible purchase using an enrolled Card, except that some Corporate Card Members enrolled in\\n\\nthe Rewards Program will earn one point for every two dollars, charged on the Corporate Card, depending on the earn rate selected by the company for its employees enrolled in the Rewards Program. The earn rate selected will apply to all eligible purchases made on the Corporate Card.\\n\\nAn eligible purchase is anything except:\\n\\nCash advances and cash equivalents, including Gift Cards\\n\\nPerson-to-person transactions • Balance transfers • Express Cash or Corporate Express Cash • Purchases of traveler\\'s checks • American Express Gift Cards bought online • Purchases or reloading of prepaid cards • Fees or interest charges on your Card Account • Foreign exchange fees and fees for account services • Fees for any Card Member services you enroll in • Rewards Program fees and charges • Purchases covered by points or other rewards at point of sale\\n\\nThis list of eligible purchases and exclusions is determined by American Express in its’ sole discretion and is subject to change at any time, without notice. We may remove points from your Rewards Account if we determine that those points were earned on ineligible purchases. You earn points for eligible purchases only if we receive timely payment of the minimum amount due on your Card Account billing statement. If your Card Account is a Consumer Card Account or a Business Card Account, you must pay the amount due on your billing statement so that we receive your payment by the Payment Due Date shown on that billing statement. If your Card Account is a Corporate Card account, you must pay the amount due on your Card Account statement so that we receive your payment by the Closing Date of the next billing period.', \"If you don't make a timely payment of the minimum amount due on your Card Account, any points accrued from that Card Account during the period covered by the billing statement will not be earned and will not post to your Rewards Account. You can eventually earn these points, but first you must pay the amounts due on your Card Account or Accounts. After you pay the amounts due on your Card Account, you must request those points from us and pay a $35 fee for each billing period, and each Card Account, for which you requested the points. You must request the points within 12 months after the billing period in which you didn't earn them.\\n\\nConditions for earning additional points:\\n\\nCheck the 'Compare Products' section of these Terms and Conditions to see if your Card earns additional points for certain purchases. You can check your online account to see 2\\n\\nwhich of your recent purchases earned additional points.\\n\\nMerchants are assigned codes based on what they primarily sell. We group certain merchant codes into categories that are eligible to earn additional points. A purchase with a merchant will not earn additional points if the merchant's code is not included in an additional points category.\\n\\nYou may not receive additional points if we receive inaccurate information or are otherwise unable to identify your purchase as eligible for an additional points category. For example, you may not receive additional points when:\\n\\na merchant uses a third-party to sell their products or services; or\\n\\na merchant uses a third-party to process or submit your transaction to us (e.g., using mobile or wireless card readers); or\\n\\nyou choose to make a purchase using a third- party payment account or make a purchase using a mobile or digital wallet.\\n\\nFor frequently asked questions about how merchants are categorized or whether purchases made with third parties are eligible for additional rewards, please visit americanexpress.com/en- us/benefits/rewards/rewards-information/.\\n\\nFor questions about additional points on a purchase, call the number on the back of your Card.

You must link your Rewards Account with your partner loyalty program account before you can transfer points. In order to link your accounts, the partner loyalty program account must be in your name or the name of an Additional Card Member on your Card Account. An Additional Card must be issued to the Additional Card Member at least 90 days prior to linking your program account to that Additional Card Member's partner loyalty account.\\n\\nOnce you transfer points, the partner loyalty program's terms and conditions apply. Since we have no control over these programs, you're responsible for understanding all guidelines and restrictions before\\n\\ntransferring points. For most partner loyalty programs, 1,000 Membership Rewards points will equal 1,000 miles, points or credits.\\n\\nThe exceptions are:\\n\\nAeromexico: 1,000 points = 1,600 Club Premier points • Hilton: 1,000 points = 2,000 Hilton Honors points • JetBlue Airways: 250 points = 200 JetBlue TrueBlue® points; must be transferred in 50-point increments\\n\\nYou'll pay an excise tax offset fee ($0.0006 per point, up to $99) for points transferred to a U.S. airline frequent flyer program. This fee offsets the federal excise tax we must pay when you transfer points. It may be more or less than the actual amount of the excise tax we pay on any individual transfer.\\n\\nIf you book a flight using frequent flyer miles, it won't be charged to your Card Account. This means you won't receive insurance and other benefits that may apply when you charge a flight to your Card Account.\", \"If an airline loyalty program stops participating in the Rewards Program, we may limit the number of points you can transfer to that loyalty program before its participation ends. This limit will be at least 100,000 points.\\n\\n1If the only Card Product linked to your Rewards Account is a Legacy Card, this redemption option is not available to you.\\n\\nUseful Tips:\\n\\n1.

In most cases, you must transfer a minimum of 1,000 points, and only in multiples of 1,000 points.\\n\\n3. Before booking tickets or hotel stays using the points you moved, be sure the points have transferred. Typically, it takes 48 hours to process the transfer but some programs delay posting points to your partner loyalty account.\\n\\n4. Points you've transferred to a partner loyalty program account can't be converted back into Membership Rewards points.\\n\\n5. Partner loyalty programs may make changes to their award levels, blackout dates, capacity controls or terms and conditions at any time.

You may proceed to litigation or arbitration regardless of the outcome of mediation.\\n\\nArbitration\\n\\nYou may elect, but are not required, to resolve any claim by individual arbitration. We may also request to resolve any claim by individual arbitration, but you are not required to accept our request. Claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator.\\n\\nIf you elect or agree to resolve a claim through arbitration, your or our right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim may be limited. Further, you and we may not have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is more limited. The arbitrator\\'s decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. Except as set forth below, the arbitrator\\'s decision will be final and binding. Other rights you or we would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.\\n\\nInitiating Arbitration\\n\\nIf you and we agree to proceed to arbitration, claims will be referred to either JAMS or AAA, as selected by the party electing arbitration. Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration provision and the selected organization\\'s rules in effect when the claim is filed, except where those rules conflict with these Terms & Conditions. If we choose the organization, you may select the other within 30 days after receiving notice of our selection. Contact JAMS or AAA to begin an arbitration or for other information. Claims also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and we agree in writing or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA). We will not request arbitration for any claim you file in small claims court, so long as the claim is individual and pending only in that court. You may otherwise elect to arbitrate any claim at any time unless it has been filed in court and trial has begun or final judgment has been entered.\\n\\n11\\n\\nLimitation on Arbitration\\n\\nArbitration Fees and Costs', \"11\\n\\nLimitation on Arbitration\\n\\nArbitration Fees and Costs\\n\\nIf the parties agree to resolve a claim by arbitration, that claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to that agreement, and the agreement would not allow claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other Card Members or other persons similarly situated. The arbitrator's authority is limited to claims between you and us alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless you and we agree in writing. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award. Notwithstanding any other provision and without waiving the right to appeal such decision, if any portion of these Limitations on Arbitration provisions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration provision (other than this sentence) will not apply.\\n\\nYou will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in court. We will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees.\\n\\nAt your written request, we will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.\\n\\nAdditional Arbitration Awards\\n\\nIf the arbitrator rules in your favor for an amount greater than any final offer we made before arbitration, the arbitrator's award will include:\\n\\n1. Any money to which you are entitled, but in nocase less than $5,000; and\\n\\nArbitration Procedures\\n\\n2. Any reasonable attorneys' fees, costs andexpert and other witness fees.\\n\\nThis Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, statutes of limitations and privileges. The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery. Subject to the Limitations on Arbitration provisions, the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court. The arbitration will be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your claim.\\n\\nContinuation\\n\\nThis section will survive termination of the program or your participation in it. If any portion of this Claims Resolution section, except as otherwise provided in the Limitations on Arbitration subsection, is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this Claims Resolution section.\\n\\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in person hearing. At any party's request, the arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have 30 days to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing. The organization will appoint a three arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. At your election, arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.\\n\\nQuestions?\\n\\nIf you have questions about anything in these Terms and Conditions, call us at 1-800-AXP-EARN (1-800-297-3276)\\n\\n12\\n\\nCompare Products\\n\\nThe table below shows the American Express products that are eligible to participate in the Rewards Program.

The return does not reduce your purchase count but it does reduce the points on those purchases from 500 to 300. So, you would earn 20% extra points on the 300 points.) To count purchases, we use the purchase date. In rare instances, a purchase may not post to your account for several billing periods. If a purchase posts to your account more than 4 billing periods after the purchase date, we will count it in the billing period in which it posts.

You are not required to resolve your claim through mediation or arbitration. You may decline our request to resolve a claim through mediation or arbitration. You may elect to resolve your claim through litigation.\\n\\nMediation\\n\\nIf you elect to resolve your claim through mediation, a neutral mediator will help resolve the claim. The mediator does not decide the claim but helps parties reach agreement. Before beginning mediation, you or we must first send a claim notice. Within 30 days after sending or receiving a claim notice, you or we may submit the claim to JAMS (1-800-352-5267, jamsadr.com) or the American Arbitration Association (\\\"AAA\\\") (1-800-778-7879, adr.org)\\n\\nfor mediation. We will pay the fees of the mediator. All mediation-related communications are confidential, inadmissible in court and not subject to discovery. All applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled until termination of the mediation. Either you or we may terminate the mediation at any time. The submission or failure to submit a claim to mediation will not affect your or our right to elect litigation or arbitration. The outcome of mediation proceedings is non-binding. You may proceed to litigation or arbitration regardless of the outcome of mediation.\\n\\nArbitration\\n\\nYou may elect, but are not required, to resolve any claim by individual arbitration. We may also request to resolve any claim by individual arbitration, but you are not required to accept our request. Claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator.\\n\\nIf you elect or agree to resolve a claim through arbitration, your or our right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim may be limited. Further, you and we may not have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is more limited. The arbitrator's decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. Except as set forth below, the arbitrator's decision will be final and binding. Other rights you or we would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.\\n\\nInitiating Arbitration\\n\\nIf you and we agree to proceed to arbitration, claims will be referred to either JAMS or AAA, as selected by the party electing arbitration. Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration provision and the selected organization's rules in effect when the claim is filed, except where those rules conflict with these Terms & Conditions. If we choose the organization, you may select the other within 30 days after receiving notice of our selection. Contact JAMS or AAA to begin an arbitration or for other information. Claims also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and we agree in writing or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA). We will not request arbitration for any claim you file in small claims court, so long as the claim is individual and pending only in that court.

The appeal will otherwise proceed pursuant to the arbitration organization's appellate rules. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. At your election, arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.\\n\\nArbitration Fees and Costs\\n\\nYou will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in court. We will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees. At your written request, we will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.\\n\\nAdditional Arbitration Awards\\n\\nIf the arbitrator rules in your favor for an amount greater than any final offer we made before the final hearing in arbitration, the arbitrator's award will include:\\n\\n1.

Claim means any current or future claim, dispute or controversy relating to your participation in the program, these Terms & Conditions, or any prior program agreement, except for the validity, enforceability or scope of the Arbitration provision. Claim includes but is not limited to:\\n\\n1. Initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third- party claims;\\n\\n2. Claims based upon contract, tort, fraud, statute, regulation, common law and equity;\\n\\n3. Claims by or against any third party using or providing any product or service in connection with the program; and\\n\\n4.

Go to americanexpress.com/claim for a sample claim notice. The claim notice should describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded. We may also request that we resolve a claim by mediation or arbitration, but you are not required to accept our request.\\n\\nWe may include our request with your billing statement or mail it to your home address.

The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, statutes of limitations and privileges. The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery. Subject to the Limitations on Arbitration provisions, the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court. The arbitration will be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your claim.\\n\\nContinuation\\n\\nThis section will survive termination of the program or your participation in it. If any portion of this Claims Resolution section, except as otherwise provided in the Limitations on Arbitration subsection, is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this Claims Resolution section.\\n\\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in person hearing. At any party's request, the arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have 30 days to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing. The organization will appoint a three arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

A transaction where you buy multiple items counts as one purchase. Purchases do not include cash advances, balance transfers, purchases of travelers cheques, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents. Does not apply to limited time promotions and offers (such as a Welcome Bonus). Returns and credits do not reduce your purchase count but will reduce the number of points and extra points earned. (Example: Suppose in a billing period you make 30 purchases totaling $500 and you return a $200 item that you purchased in the same or a prior billing period. The return does not reduce your purchase count but it does reduce the points on those purchases from 500 to 300. So, you would earn 50% extra points on the 300 points.) To count purchases, we use the purchase date. In rare instances, a purchase may not post to your account for several billing periods. If a purchase posts to your account more than 4 billing periods after the purchase date, we will count it in the billing period in which it posts. Some merchants combine separate charges into a single transaction. When this happens, the combined charges will count as a single purchase for the purpose of counting purchases. The purchase date may not be the date you made a transaction - for example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped. The 50% extra points are typically awarded 6 to 8 weeks after the billing period in which you make the 30 or more eligible purchases.\\n\\n2 additional points (for a total of 3 points) for each dollar charged on eligible travel purchases including airfare, hotels, cruises, car rentals, campgrounds, trains, taxicabs, rideshare services, tours, ferries, tolls, parking, buses, subways, on third party travel websites, and on amextravel.com.
