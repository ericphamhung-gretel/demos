The arbitrator's authority is limited to claims between you and us alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless you and we agree in writing. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award. Notwithstanding any other provision and without waiving the right to appeal such decision, if any portion of these Limitations on Arbitration provisions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration provision (other than this sentence) will not apply.\\n\\nYou will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in court. We will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees.\\n\\nAt your written request, we will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.\\n\\nAdditional Arbitration Awards\\n\\nIf the arbitrator rules in your favor for an amount greater than any final offer we made before arbitration, the arbitrator's award will include:\\n\\n1. Any money to which you are entitled, but in nocase less than $5,000; and\\n\\nArbitration Procedures\\n\\n2. Any reasonable attorneys' fees, costs andexpert and other witness fees.\\n\\nThis Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, statutes of limitations and privileges. The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery. Subject to the Limitations on Arbitration provisions, the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court. The arbitration will be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your claim.\\n\\nContinuation\\n\\nThis section will survive termination of the program or your participation in it. If any portion of this Claims Resolution section, except as otherwise provided in the Limitations on Arbitration subsection, is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this Claims Resolution section.\\n\\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in person hearing. At any party's request, the arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have 30 days to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing. The organization will appoint a three arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. At your election, arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.\\n\\nQuestions?\\n\\nIf you have questions about anything in these Terms and Conditions, call us at 1-800-AXP-EARN (1-800-297-3276)\\n\\n12\\n\\nCompare Products\\n\\nThe table below shows the American Express products that are eligible to participate in the Rewards Program.

For terms and conditions related to a specific product, please refer to the separate document(s) that you received upon enrollment.\\n\\nWe may make changes to the Rewards Program, and we may add to and/or change these Terms and Conditions at any time.\\n\\nFor example, we could:\\n\\nChange the number of Membership Rewards\\u00ae points (points) you can earn for eligible purchases \\u2022 Change the number of points required to redeem\\n\\nfor rewards\\n\\nChange rewards options based on your enrolled product(s)\\n\\nImpose caps and/or fees on earning and/or using points\\n\\nIncrease annual and/or other program fees \\u2022 Cancel rewards and/or the Rewards Program\\n\\nIf we cancel the Rewards Program, we'll notify you at least 90 days in advance. You'll be able to earn or use points during that time, but we may change or cancel certain rewards.\\n\\nAs part of the Membership Rewards Program, American Express may use your information as described in our Privacy Policy: https://www.americanexpress.com/us/privacy- center/.\\n\\nFor additional information and frequently asked questions, please visit us online at https://www.americanexpress.com/us/mrfaqs.\\n\\nFor a summary of recent updates to the Rewards Program, including information about the availability of redemption options, please visit: URL www.americanexpress.com/mrupdates/.\\n\\nImportant Program Details\\n\\nEligibility and enrollment:\\n\\nTo participate in the Rewards Program and to have an account (a Rewards Account), you must have at least one eligible and enrolled product (a Product).\\n\\nPlease refer to the 'Compare Products' section of these Terms and Conditions for a list of Products, enrollment requirements and other important details. We may change Product eligibility at any time.\\n\\nIn these Terms and Conditions, when we say \\\"Card\\\" or \\\"Card Account\\\", we are referring to a credit or charge Card Product. When we say \\\"Card Member\\\", we are referring to a holder of a Card or Card Account. We will separately refer to a Debit Card and Debit Card holders, which are linked to a Checking Account, throughout these Terms and Conditions, where applicable.\\n\\nYou're receiving this document because you're the primary Card Account holder (a Basic Card Member) or the primary account holder of another Product. Your Product is now enrolled in the Rewards Program. Additional Card Members on Consumer Card Accounts and Business Card Accounts will not have their own Rewards Accounts. Additional Card Members or Additional Business Card Members are those who have Cards tied to your Card Account.\\n\\nRewards Account Linking and Redemption Options:\\n\\nIf you have multiple Products, we may automatically link them to the same Rewards Account. Your ability to use points may differ based on your Product and/or the Products linked to the Rewards Account.\\n\\nIf you would like to link or delink any of the Products to the same Rewards Account, you may call us at the number listed on the back of your Card to do so.\\n\\nThe ways you can use points may vary depending on the Product(s) linked to your Rewards Account. Most Card Products will provide access to all available redemption options. However, if you only have a Legacy Card Product linked to your Rewards Account, availability of redemption options will be limited as more particularly described in the section titled 'Program Terms & Conditions for Card Members' (see the 'Compare Products' section for a list of 'Legacy Cards'). Alternatively, if you do not have any Card Account linked to your Rewards Account, and you only have a Checking Account linked to your Rewards Account, available redemption options are also limited as described further in the sections titled 'Program Terms & Conditions for Checking Accounts'.\\n\\n1\",\n          \"arbitration organization and all parties in writing within 35 days after the arbitrator's award is issued. The arbitration organization will appoint a three-arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to. The appeal will otherwise proceed pursuant to the arbitration organization's appellate rules. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. At your election, arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.\\n\\nArbitration Fees and Costs\\n\\nYou will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in court. We will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees. At your written request, we will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.\\n\\nAdditional Arbitration Awards\\n\\nIf the arbitrator rules in your favor for an amount greater than any final offer we made before the final hearing in arbitration, the arbitrator's award will include:\\n\\n1. Any money to which you are entitled, but in no case less than $5,000; and\\n\\n2. Any reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expert and other witness fees.\\n\\nContinuation\\n\\nThis section will survive termination of the program or your participation in it. If any portion of this Claims Resolution section, except as otherwise provided in the Limitations on Arbitration subsection, is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this Claims Resolution section.\\n\\nClaims Resolution for Military Lending Act (MLA) Covered Borrowers\\n\\nMost customer concerns can be resolved by calling our Customer Service Department at the number listed on the back of your Card. In the event Customer Service is unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, this section explains how claims can be resolved through litigation, non-binding mediation or, at your election, arbitration. You are not required to resolve any claims by mediation and arbitration. For this section, you and us includes any corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related\\n\\n10\\n\\npersons or entities. Claim means any current or future claim, dispute or controversy relating to your participation in the program, these Terms & Conditions, or any prior program agreement, except for the validity, enforceability or scope of the Arbitration provision. Claim includes but is not limited to:\\n\\n1. Initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third- party claims;\\n\\n2. Claims based upon contract, tort, fraud, statute, regulation, common law and equity;\\n\\n3. Claims by or against any third party using or providing any product or service in connection with the program; and\\n\\n4. Claims that arise from or relate to (a) the program account or any point balances on the program account, (b) advertisements, promotions or statements related to the program or any reward, and (c) the redemption for and use of any reward. You may not sell, assign or transfer a claim.\\n\\nSending a Claim Notice\\n\\nBefore beginning a lawsuit, arbitration or non-binding mediation, you may send a written notice (a claim notice) to us. Go to americanexpress.com/claim for a sample claim notice. The claim notice should describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded. We may also request that we resolve a claim by mediation or arbitration, but you are not required to accept our request.\\n\\nWe may include our request with your billing statement or mail it to your home address. Notice to us should include your name, address and Account number and be sent to:\\n\\nAmerican Express ADR c/o CT Corporation System, 28 Liberty St NY, NY 10005\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"difficulty\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"medium\",\n          \"easy\",\n          \"hard\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sophistication\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"basic\",\n          \"intermediate\",\n          \"advanced\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_style\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"comparative\",\n          \"factual\",\n          \"exploratory\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target_audience\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"expert\",\n          \"intermediate\",\n          \"novice\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_format\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"detailed\",\n          \"step-by-step\",\n          \"short\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"qa_pair\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{\\\"question\\\": \\\"How do Corporate Card Members and Individual Card Members differ in terms of earning points?\\\", \\\"answer\\\": \\\"To determine how Corporate Card Members and Individual Card Members differ in terms of earning points, follow these steps:\\\\n\\\\n1. Check if you are a Corporate Card Member or an Individual Card Member.\\\\n2. If you are a Corporate Card Member, look at the earn rate selected by the company for its employees enrolled in the Rewards Program.\\\\n3. If the company has selected an earn rate of one point for every two dollars charged on the Corporate Card, then you will earn one point for every two dollars charged on the Corporate Card.\\\\n4. If the company has selected a different earn rate, then you will earn points based on that rate.\\\\n5. If you are an Individual Card Member, you will earn one point for every dollar of spend on an eligible purchase using an enrolled Card.\\\\n\\\\nNote that some Corporate Card Members may earn one point for every two dollars charged on the Corporate Card, while Individual Card Members earn one point for every dollar of spend on an eligible purchase.\\\", \\\"reasoning\\\": \\\"This Q&A pair is valuable because it clarifies the difference in earning points between Corporate Card Members and Individual Card Members, which can be a source of confusion for users.

The arbitrator's authority is limited to claims between you and us alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless you and we agree in writing. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award. Notwithstanding any other provision and without waiving the right to appeal such decision, if any portion of these Limitations on Arbitration provisions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration provision (other than this sentence) will not apply.\\n\\nYou will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in court. We will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees.\\n\\nAt your written request, we will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.\\n\\nAdditional Arbitration Awards\\n\\nIf the arbitrator rules in your favor for an amount greater than any final offer we made before arbitration, the arbitrator's award will include:\\n\\n1. Any money to which you are entitled, but in nocase less than $5,000; and\\n\\nArbitration Procedures\\n\\n2. Any reasonable attorneys' fees, costs andexpert and other witness fees.\\n\\nThis Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, statutes of limitations and privileges. The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery. Subject to the Limitations on Arbitration provisions, the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court. The arbitration will be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your claim.\\n\\nContinuation\\n\\nThis section will survive termination of the program or your participation in it. If any portion of this Claims Resolution section, except as otherwise provided in the Limitations on Arbitration subsection, is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this Claims Resolution section.\\n\\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in person hearing. At any party's request, the arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have 30 days to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing. The organization will appoint a three arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. At your election, arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.\\n\\nQuestions?\\n\\nIf you have questions about anything in these Terms and Conditions, call us at 1-800-AXP-EARN (1-800-297-3276)\\n\\n12\\n\\nCompare Products\\n\\nThe table below shows the American Express products that are eligible to participate in the Rewards Program.

For terms and conditions related to a specific product, please refer to the separate document(s) that you received upon enrollment.\\n\\nWe may make changes to the Rewards Program, and we may add to and/or change these Terms and Conditions at any time.\\n\\nFor example, we could:\\n\\nChange the number of Membership Rewards\\u00ae points (points) you can earn for eligible purchases \\u2022 Change the number of points required to redeem\\n\\nfor rewards\\n\\nChange rewards options based on your enrolled product(s)\\n\\nImpose caps and/or fees on earning and/or using points\\n\\nIncrease annual and/or other program fees \\u2022 Cancel rewards and/or the Rewards Program\\n\\nIf we cancel the Rewards Program, we'll notify you at least 90 days in advance. You'll be able to earn or use points during that time, but we may change or cancel certain rewards.\\n\\nAs part of the Membership Rewards Program, American Express may use your information as described in our Privacy Policy: https://www.americanexpress.com/us/privacy- center/.\\n\\nFor additional information and frequently asked questions, please visit us online at https://www.americanexpress.com/us/mrfaqs.\\n\\nFor a summary of recent updates to the Rewards Program, including information about the availability of redemption options, please visit: URL www.americanexpress.com/mrupdates/.\\n\\nImportant Program Details\\n\\nEligibility and enrollment:\\n\\nTo participate in the Rewards Program and to have an account (a Rewards Account), you must have at least one eligible and enrolled product (a Product).\\n\\nPlease refer to the 'Compare Products' section of these Terms and Conditions for a list of Products, enrollment requirements and other important details. We may change Product eligibility at any time.\\n\\nIn these Terms and Conditions, when we say \\\"Card\\\" or \\\"Card Account\\\", we are referring to a credit or charge Card Product. When we say \\\"Card Member\\\", we are referring to a holder of a Card or Card Account. We will separately refer to a Debit Card and Debit Card holders, which are linked to a Checking Account, throughout these Terms and Conditions, where applicable.\\n\\nYou're receiving this document because you're the primary Card Account holder (a Basic Card Member) or the primary account holder of another Product. Your Product is now enrolled in the Rewards Program. Additional Card Members on Consumer Card Accounts and Business Card Accounts will not have their own Rewards Accounts. Additional Card Members or Additional Business Card Members are those who have Cards tied to your Card Account.\\n\\nRewards Account Linking and Redemption Options:\\n\\nIf you have multiple Products, we may automatically link them to the same Rewards Account. Your ability to use points may differ based on your Product and/or the Products linked to the Rewards Account.\\n\\nIf you would like to link or delink any of the Products to the same Rewards Account, you may call us at the number listed on the back of your Card to do so.\\n\\nThe ways you can use points may vary depending on the Product(s) linked to your Rewards Account. Most Card Products will provide access to all available redemption options. However, if you only have a Legacy Card Product linked to your Rewards Account, availability of redemption options will be limited as more particularly described in the section titled 'Program Terms & Conditions for Card Members' (see the 'Compare Products' section for a list of 'Legacy Cards'). Alternatively, if you do not have any Card Account linked to your Rewards Account, and you only have a Checking Account linked to your Rewards Account, available redemption options are also limited as described further in the sections titled 'Program Terms & Conditions for Checking Accounts'.\\n\\n1\",\n          \"arbitration organization and all parties in writing within 35 days after the arbitrator's award is issued. The arbitration organization will appoint a three-arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to. The appeal will otherwise proceed pursuant to the arbitration organization's appellate rules. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. At your election, arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.\\n\\nArbitration Fees and Costs\\n\\nYou will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in court. We will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees. At your written request, we will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.\\n\\nAdditional Arbitration Awards\\n\\nIf the arbitrator rules in your favor for an amount greater than any final offer we made before the final hearing in arbitration, the arbitrator's award will include:\\n\\n1. Any money to which you are entitled, but in no case less than $5,000; and\\n\\n2. Any reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expert and other witness fees.\\n\\nContinuation\\n\\nThis section will survive termination of the program or your participation in it. If any portion of this Claims Resolution section, except as otherwise provided in the Limitations on Arbitration subsection, is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this Claims Resolution section.\\n\\nClaims Resolution for Military Lending Act (MLA) Covered Borrowers\\n\\nMost customer concerns can be resolved by calling our Customer Service Department at the number listed on the back of your Card. In the event Customer Service is unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, this section explains how claims can be resolved through litigation, non-binding mediation or, at your election, arbitration. You are not required to resolve any claims by mediation and arbitration. For this section, you and us includes any corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related\\n\\n10\\n\\npersons or entities. Claim means any current or future claim, dispute or controversy relating to your participation in the program, these Terms & Conditions, or any prior program agreement, except for the validity, enforceability or scope of the Arbitration provision. Claim includes but is not limited to:\\n\\n1. Initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third- party claims;\\n\\n2. Claims based upon contract, tort, fraud, statute, regulation, common law and equity;\\n\\n3. Claims by or against any third party using or providing any product or service in connection with the program; and\\n\\n4. Claims that arise from or relate to (a) the program account or any point balances on the program account, (b) advertisements, promotions or statements related to the program or any reward, and (c) the redemption for and use of any reward. You may not sell, assign or transfer a claim.\\n\\nSending a Claim Notice\\n\\nBefore beginning a lawsuit, arbitration or non-binding mediation, you may send a written notice (a claim notice) to us. Go to americanexpress.com/claim for a sample claim notice. The claim notice should describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded. We may also request that we resolve a claim by mediation or arbitration, but you are not required to accept our request.\\n\\nWe may include our request with your billing statement or mail it to your home address. Notice to us should include your name, address and Account number and be sent to:\\n\\nAmerican Express ADR c/o CT Corporation System, 28 Liberty St NY, NY 10005\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"difficulty\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"medium\",\n          \"easy\",\n          \"hard\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sophistication\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"basic\",\n          \"intermediate\",\n          \"advanced\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_style\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"comparative\",\n          \"factual\",\n          \"exploratory\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target_audience\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"expert\",\n          \"intermediate\",\n          \"novice\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_format\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"detailed\",\n          \"step-by-step\",\n          \"short\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"qa_pair\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{\\\"question\\\": \\\"How do Corporate Card Members and Individual Card Members differ in terms of earning points?\\\", \\\"answer\\\": \\\"To determine how Corporate Card Members and Individual Card Members differ in terms of earning points, follow these steps:\\\\n\\\\n1.

If you are a Corporate Card Member, look at the earn rate selected by the company for its employees enrolled in the Rewards Program.\\\\n3. If the company has selected an earn rate of one point for every two dollars charged on the Corporate Card, then you will earn one point for every two dollars charged on the Corporate Card.\\\\n4. If the company has selected a different earn rate, then you will earn points based on that rate.\\\\n5. If you are an Individual Card Member, you will earn one point for every dollar of spend on an eligible purchase using an enrolled Card.\\\\n\\\\nNote that some Corporate Card Members may earn one point for every two dollars charged on the Corporate Card, while Individual Card Members earn one point for every dollar of spend on an eligible purchase.\\\", \\\"reasoning\\\": \\\"This Q&A pair is valuable because it clarifies the difference in earning points between Corporate Card Members and Individual Card Members, which can be a source of confusion for users.
