You can eventually earn these points, but first you must pay the amounts due on your Card Account or Accounts. After you pay the amounts due on your Card Account, you must request those points from us and pay a $35 fee for each billing period, and each Card Account, for which you requested the points. You must request the points within 12 months after the billing period in which you didn't earn them.\\n\\nConditions for earning additional points:\\n\\nCheck the 'Compare Products' section of these Terms and Conditions to see if your Card earns additional points for certain purchases. You can check your online account to see 2\\n\\nwhich of your recent purchases earned additional points.\\n\\nMerchants are assigned codes based on what they primarily sell. We group certain merchant codes into categories that are eligible to earn additional points. A purchase with a merchant will not earn additional points if the merchant's code is not included in an additional points category.\\n\\nYou may not receive additional points if we receive inaccurate information or are otherwise unable to identify your purchase as eligible for an additional points category. For example, you may not receive additional points when:\\n\\na merchant uses a third-party to sell their products or services; or\\n\\na merchant uses a third-party to process or submit your transaction to us (e.g., using mobile or wireless card readers); or\\n\\nyou choose to make a purchase using a third- party payment account or make a purchase using a mobile or digital wallet.\\n\\nFor frequently asked questions about how merchants are categorized or whether purchases made with third parties are eligible for additional rewards, please visit americanexpress.com/en- us/benefits/rewards/rewards-information/.\\n\\nFor questions about additional points on a purchase, call the number on the back of your Card. Please visit membershiprewards.com/pointsinfo for more information about rewards.\\n\\nWhen you return a reward\\n\\nWhen you return a reward you got with points, you'll either get the points back in your Rewards Account or get a credit on your Card Account. If you get a credit, you may be able to change it back into points. Ask us at 1-800-AXP-EARN (297-3276).\\n\\nUse Points\\n\\nTransfer points to partner loyalty programs1\\n\\nYou may be able to transfer points to participating partner loyalty programs, like those offered by airlines and hotels. You must link your Rewards Account with your partner loyalty program account before you can transfer points. In order to link your accounts, the partner loyalty program account must be in your name or the name of an Additional Card Member on your Card Account. An Additional Card must be issued to the Additional Card Member at least 90 days prior to linking your program account to that Additional Card Member's partner loyalty account.\\n\\nOnce you transfer points, the partner loyalty program's terms and conditions apply. Since we have no control over these programs, you're responsible for understanding all guidelines and restrictions before\\n\\ntransferring points. For most partner loyalty programs, 1,000 Membership Rewards points will equal 1,000 miles, points or credits.\\n\\nThe exceptions are:\\n\\nAeromexico: 1,000 points = 1,600 Club Premier points \\u2022 Hilton: 1,000 points = 2,000 Hilton Honors points \\u2022 JetBlue Airways: 250 points = 200 JetBlue TrueBlue\\u00ae points; must be transferred in 50-point increments\\n\\nYou'll pay an excise tax offset fee ($0.0006 per point, up to $99) for points transferred to a U.S. airline frequent flyer program. This fee offsets the federal excise tax we must pay when you transfer points. It may be more or less than the actual amount of the excise tax we pay on any individual transfer.\\n\\nIf you book a flight using frequent flyer miles, it won't be charged to your Card Account. This means you won't receive insurance and other benefits that may apply when you charge a flight to your Card Account.\",\n          \"American Express ADR c/o CT Corporation System, 28 Liberty St NY, NY 10005\\n\\nIf the claim proceeds to litigation, mediation or arbitration, the amount of any relief demanded in a claim notice will not be disclosed.

You may elect to resolve your claim through litigation.\\n\\nMediation\\n\\nIf you elect to resolve your claim through mediation, a neutral mediator will help resolve the claim. The mediator does not decide the claim but helps parties reach agreement. Before beginning mediation, you or we must first send a claim notice. Within 30 days after sending or receiving a claim notice, you or we may submit the claim to JAMS (1-800-352-5267, jamsadr.com) or the American Arbitration Association (\\\"AAA\\\") (1-800-778-7879, adr.org)\\n\\nfor mediation. We will pay the fees of the mediator. All mediation-related communications are confidential, inadmissible in court and not subject to discovery. All applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled until termination of the mediation. Either you or we may terminate the mediation at any time. The submission or failure to submit a claim to mediation will not affect your or our right to elect litigation or arbitration. The outcome of mediation proceedings is non-binding. You may proceed to litigation or arbitration regardless of the outcome of mediation.\\n\\nArbitration\\n\\nYou may elect, but are not required, to resolve any claim by individual arbitration. We may also request to resolve any claim by individual arbitration, but you are not required to accept our request. Claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator.\\n\\nIf you elect or agree to resolve a claim through arbitration, your or our right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim may be limited. Further, you and we may not have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is more limited. The arbitrator's decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. Except as set forth below, the arbitrator's decision will be final and binding. Other rights you or we would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.\\n\\nInitiating Arbitration\\n\\nIf you and we agree to proceed to arbitration, claims will be referred to either JAMS or AAA, as selected by the party electing arbitration. Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration provision and the selected organization's rules in effect when the claim is filed, except where those rules conflict with these Terms & Conditions. If we choose the organization, you may select the other within 30 days after receiving notice of our selection. Contact JAMS or AAA to begin an arbitration or for other information. Claims also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and we agree in writing or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA). We will not request arbitration for any claim you file in small claims court, so long as the claim is individual and pending only in that court. You may otherwise elect to arbitrate any claim at any time unless it has been filed in court and trial has begun or final judgment has been entered.\\n\\n11\\n\\nLimitation on Arbitration\\n\\nArbitration Fees and Costs\",\n          \"If an airline loyalty program stops participating in the Rewards Program, we may limit the number of points you can transfer to that loyalty program before its participation ends. This limit will be at least 100,000 points.\\n\\n1If the only Card Product linked to your Rewards Account is a Legacy Card, this redemption option is not available to you.\\n\\nUseful Tips:\\n\\n1. To transfer points, you must first link your partner loyalty program account to your Rewards Account.\\n\\n2. Then choose the number of points you want to transfer. In most cases, you must transfer a minimum of 1,000 points, and only in multiples of 1,000 points.\\n\\n3. Before booking tickets or hotel stays using the points you moved, be sure the points have transferred. Typically, it takes 48 hours to process the transfer but some programs delay posting points to your partner loyalty account.\\n\\n4. Points you've transferred to a partner loyalty program account can't be converted back into Membership Rewards points.\\n\\n5. Partner loyalty programs may make changes to their award levels, blackout dates, capacity controls or terms and conditions at any time. We are not responsible for telling you about any changes the partner loyalty programs may make.\\n\\n3\\n\\nUse Pay with Points\\n\\nYou can use Pay with Points for purchases with your Card in many places - American Express Travel, Amazon.com, Best Buy and other retailers. However, if the only Card Product linked to your Rewards Account is a Legacy Card, Pay with Points is available only for American Express Travel and not with other retailers.\\n\\nWhen you use Pay with Points, we will:\\n\\nCharge your Card Account for the purchase \\u2022 Deduct the points from your Rewards Account \\u2022 Apply a credit to your Card Account to reflect the points used\\n\\nIf the points you used don't cover the full cost of the purchase, the difference will remain charged to your Card Account.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nIf you spend 500 and use points to cover $300, we'll:\\n\\nCharge your Card Account $500 \\u2022 Apply a $300 credit to your Card Account \\u2022 You will see both a $500 charge and $300 statement credit on your Card Account\\n\\nUse of the Pay with Points redemption option requires a charge to your Card Account and is subject to the terms of your Card Member agreement, including applicable credit limits and other restrictions. If you are unable to make a purchase on your Card Account for any reason, you will not be able to use Pay with Points.\\n\\nThe credit to your Card Account may appear during a different billing cycle than the charge for the purchase. Even if you expect a credit on a future billing statement, you must pay the minimum amount due on each billing statement by the due date.\\n\\nIf you use a Pay Over Time feature (such as Pay Over Time Direct on a Consumer Card) for a purchase using Pay with Points, the billing statement credit you get may not be applied to that feature. Instead, it might be applied to your Pay in Full Balance. If you think this has happened, please call us at the number on the back of your Card.\\n\\nSome Pay with Points redemptions may have a required minimum.\\n\\nUse Pay with Points at Amazon.com1\\n\\nIn addition to these Terms and Conditions, the terms and conditions for Amazon.com's 'Shop With Points' Program apply to the use of Pay with Points on eligible purchases made with points on Amazon.com.\\n\\nHow it works:\\n\\n1. Add your eligible Card Account to your Amazon.com account.\\n\\n2. Link your Rewards Account to your Amazon.com account by either: (a) making a purchase with your eligible Card Account on Amazon.com; or (b) selecting Learn More next to your eligible Card Account at checkout and completing the steps. Please allow up to 72 hours for your Rewards Account to be linked. If you want to use points immediately after adding your eligible Card Account, you must link your Rewards Account via option 2(b) above.\\n\\n3. When you link your Rewards Account to your Amazon.com account, information about your Rewards Account will be shared with Amazon and you'll be able to see a points balance and use points on Amazon.com.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"difficulty\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"medium\",\n          \"hard\",\n          \"easy\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sophistication\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"sophisticated\",\n          \"advanced\",\n          \"intermediate\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_style\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"exploratory\",\n          \"comparative\",\n          \"factual\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target_audience\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"novice\",\n          \"intermediate\",\n          \"expert\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_format\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"step-by-step\",\n          \"list\",\n          \"detailed\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"qa_pair\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{\\\"question\\\": \\\"What is the key difference in the Rewards Program enrollment process between a Corporate Card and a Legacy Card, specifically for novice Corporate Card holders unfamiliar with the process?\\\", \\\"answer\\\": \\\"For Corporate Cards, enrollment in the Rewards Program requires a non-refundable annual program fee, paid on the anniversary of the enrollment date. This is determined by the company issuing the Corporate Card and can be changed at any time. Additionally, only Corporate Cards issued in the account holder's name can enroll. If your company blocks Corporate Card enrollment in the Rewards Program, you will be ineligible. This differs from Legacy Cards, which can be enrolled through their Business Management Account, and in some cases, with no additional fees or enrollment process required. It is essential for novice Corporate Card holders to understand this difference to ensure they meet the enrollment requirements correctly.\\\", \\\"reasoning\\\": \\\"This Q&A pair is valuable as it clarifies the critical distinctions between Corporate and Legacy Cards in the context of Rewards Program enrollment, addressing a common knowledge gap for novice Corporate Card holders.

You can eventually earn these points, but first you must pay the amounts due on your Card Account or Accounts. After you pay the amounts due on your Card Account, you must request those points from us and pay a $35 fee for each billing period, and each Card Account, for which you requested the points. You must request the points within 12 months after the billing period in which you didn't earn them.\\n\\nConditions for earning additional points:\\n\\nCheck the 'Compare Products' section of these Terms and Conditions to see if your Card earns additional points for certain purchases. You can check your online account to see 2\\n\\nwhich of your recent purchases earned additional points.\\n\\nMerchants are assigned codes based on what they primarily sell. We group certain merchant codes into categories that are eligible to earn additional points. A purchase with a merchant will not earn additional points if the merchant's code is not included in an additional points category.\\n\\nYou may not receive additional points if we receive inaccurate information or are otherwise unable to identify your purchase as eligible for an additional points category. For example, you may not receive additional points when:\\n\\na merchant uses a third-party to sell their products or services; or\\n\\na merchant uses a third-party to process or submit your transaction to us (e.g., using mobile or wireless card readers); or\\n\\nyou choose to make a purchase using a third- party payment account or make a purchase using a mobile or digital wallet.\\n\\nFor frequently asked questions about how merchants are categorized or whether purchases made with third parties are eligible for additional rewards, please visit americanexpress.com/en- us/benefits/rewards/rewards-information/.\\n\\nFor questions about additional points on a purchase, call the number on the back of your Card. Please visit membershiprewards.com/pointsinfo for more information about rewards.\\n\\nWhen you return a reward\\n\\nWhen you return a reward you got with points, you'll either get the points back in your Rewards Account or get a credit on your Card Account. If you get a credit, you may be able to change it back into points. Ask us at 1-800-AXP-EARN (297-3276).\\n\\nUse Points\\n\\nTransfer points to partner loyalty programs1\\n\\nYou may be able to transfer points to participating partner loyalty programs, like those offered by airlines and hotels. You must link your Rewards Account with your partner loyalty program account before you can transfer points. In order to link your accounts, the partner loyalty program account must be in your name or the name of an Additional Card Member on your Card Account. An Additional Card must be issued to the Additional Card Member at least 90 days prior to linking your program account to that Additional Card Member's partner loyalty account.\\n\\nOnce you transfer points, the partner loyalty program's terms and conditions apply. Since we have no control over these programs, you're responsible for understanding all guidelines and restrictions before\\n\\ntransferring points. For most partner loyalty programs, 1,000 Membership Rewards points will equal 1,000 miles, points or credits.\\n\\nThe exceptions are:\\n\\nAeromexico: 1,000 points = 1,600 Club Premier points \\u2022 Hilton: 1,000 points = 2,000 Hilton Honors points \\u2022 JetBlue Airways: 250 points = 200 JetBlue TrueBlue\\u00ae points; must be transferred in 50-point increments\\n\\nYou'll pay an excise tax offset fee ($0.0006 per point, up to $99) for points transferred to a U.S. airline frequent flyer program. This fee offsets the federal excise tax we must pay when you transfer points. It may be more or less than the actual amount of the excise tax we pay on any individual transfer.\\n\\nIf you book a flight using frequent flyer miles, it won't be charged to your Card Account. This means you won't receive insurance and other benefits that may apply when you charge a flight to your Card Account.\",\n          \"American Express ADR c/o CT Corporation System, 28 Liberty St NY, NY 10005\\n\\nIf the claim proceeds to litigation, mediation or arbitration, the amount of any relief demanded in a claim notice will not be disclosed. You are not required to resolve your claim through mediation or arbitration. You may decline our request to resolve a claim through mediation or arbitration. You may elect to resolve your claim through litigation.\\n\\nMediation\\n\\nIf you elect to resolve your claim through mediation, a neutral mediator will help resolve the claim. The mediator does not decide the claim but helps parties reach agreement. Before beginning mediation, you or we must first send a claim notice. Within 30 days after sending or receiving a claim notice, you or we may submit the claim to JAMS (1-800-352-5267, jamsadr.com) or the American Arbitration Association (\\\"AAA\\\") (1-800-778-7879, adr.org)\\n\\nfor mediation. We will pay the fees of the mediator. All mediation-related communications are confidential, inadmissible in court and not subject to discovery. All applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled until termination of the mediation. Either you or we may terminate the mediation at any time. The submission or failure to submit a claim to mediation will not affect your or our right to elect litigation or arbitration. The outcome of mediation proceedings is non-binding. You may proceed to litigation or arbitration regardless of the outcome of mediation.\\n\\nArbitration\\n\\nYou may elect, but are not required, to resolve any claim by individual arbitration. We may also request to resolve any claim by individual arbitration, but you are not required to accept our request. Claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator.\\n\\nIf you elect or agree to resolve a claim through arbitration, your or our right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim may be limited. Further, you and we may not have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is more limited. The arbitrator's decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. Except as set forth below, the arbitrator's decision will be final and binding. Other rights you or we would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.\\n\\nInitiating Arbitration\\n\\nIf you and we agree to proceed to arbitration, claims will be referred to either JAMS or AAA, as selected by the party electing arbitration. Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration provision and the selected organization's rules in effect when the claim is filed, except where those rules conflict with these Terms & Conditions. If we choose the organization, you may select the other within 30 days after receiving notice of our selection. Contact JAMS or AAA to begin an arbitration or for other information. Claims also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and we agree in writing or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA). We will not request arbitration for any claim you file in small claims court, so long as the claim is individual and pending only in that court. You may otherwise elect to arbitrate any claim at any time unless it has been filed in court and trial has begun or final judgment has been entered.\\n\\n11\\n\\nLimitation on Arbitration\\n\\nArbitration Fees and Costs\",\n          \"If an airline loyalty program stops participating in the Rewards Program, we may limit the number of points you can transfer to that loyalty program before its participation ends. This limit will be at least 100,000 points.\\n\\n1If the only Card Product linked to your Rewards Account is a Legacy Card, this redemption option is not available to you.\\n\\nUseful Tips:\\n\\n1. To transfer points, you must first link your partner loyalty program account to your Rewards Account.\\n\\n2. Then choose the number of points you want to transfer. In most cases, you must transfer a minimum of 1,000 points, and only in multiples of 1,000 points.\\n\\n3. Before booking tickets or hotel stays using the points you moved, be sure the points have transferred. Typically, it takes 48 hours to process the transfer but some programs delay posting points to your partner loyalty account.\\n\\n4. Points you've transferred to a partner loyalty program account can't be converted back into Membership Rewards points.\\n\\n5. Partner loyalty programs may make changes to their award levels, blackout dates, capacity controls or terms and conditions at any time. We are not responsible for telling you about any changes the partner loyalty programs may make.\\n\\n3\\n\\nUse Pay with Points\\n\\nYou can use Pay with Points for purchases with your Card in many places - American Express Travel, Amazon.com, Best Buy and other retailers. However, if the only Card Product linked to your Rewards Account is a Legacy Card, Pay with Points is available only for American Express Travel and not with other retailers.\\n\\nWhen you use Pay with Points, we will:\\n\\nCharge your Card Account for the purchase \\u2022 Deduct the points from your Rewards Account \\u2022 Apply a credit to your Card Account to reflect the points used\\n\\nIf the points you used don't cover the full cost of the purchase, the difference will remain charged to your Card Account.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nIf you spend 500 and use points to cover $300, we'll:\\n\\nCharge your Card Account $500 \\u2022 Apply a $300 credit to your Card Account \\u2022 You will see both a $500 charge and $300 statement credit on your Card Account\\n\\nUse of the Pay with Points redemption option requires a charge to your Card Account and is subject to the terms of your Card Member agreement, including applicable credit limits and other restrictions. If you are unable to make a purchase on your Card Account for any reason, you will not be able to use Pay with Points.\\n\\nThe credit to your Card Account may appear during a different billing cycle than the charge for the purchase. Even if you expect a credit on a future billing statement, you must pay the minimum amount due on each billing statement by the due date.\\n\\nIf you use a Pay Over Time feature (such as Pay Over Time Direct on a Consumer Card) for a purchase using Pay with Points, the billing statement credit you get may not be applied to that feature. Instead, it might be applied to your Pay in Full Balance. If you think this has happened, please call us at the number on the back of your Card.\\n\\nSome Pay with Points redemptions may have a required minimum.\\n\\nUse Pay with Points at Amazon.com1\\n\\nIn addition to these Terms and Conditions, the terms and conditions for Amazon.com's 'Shop With Points' Program apply to the use of Pay with Points on eligible purchases made with points on Amazon.com.\\n\\nHow it works:\\n\\n1. Add your eligible Card Account to your Amazon.com account.\\n\\n2. Link your Rewards Account to your Amazon.com account by either: (a) making a purchase with your eligible Card Account on Amazon.com; or (b) selecting Learn More next to your eligible Card Account at checkout and completing the steps. Please allow up to 72 hours for your Rewards Account to be linked. If you want to use points immediately after adding your eligible Card Account, you must link your Rewards Account via option 2(b) above.\\n\\n3. When you link your Rewards Account to your Amazon.com account, information about your Rewards Account will be shared with Amazon and you'll be able to see a points balance and use points on Amazon.com.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"difficulty\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"medium\",\n          \"hard\",\n          \"easy\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sophistication\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"sophisticated\",\n          \"advanced\",\n          \"intermediate\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_style\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"exploratory\",\n          \"comparative\",\n          \"factual\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target_audience\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"novice\",\n          \"intermediate\",\n          \"expert\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_format\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"step-by-step\",\n          \"list\",\n          \"detailed\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"qa_pair\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{\\\"question\\\": \\\"What is the key difference in the Rewards Program enrollment process between a Corporate Card and a Legacy Card, specifically for novice Corporate Card holders unfamiliar with the process?\\\", \\\"answer\\\": \\\"For Corporate Cards, enrollment in the Rewards Program requires a non-refundable annual program fee, paid on the anniversary of the enrollment date.

If your company blocks Corporate Card enrollment in the Rewards Program, you will be ineligible.
