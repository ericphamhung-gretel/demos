In the event Customer Service is unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, this section explains how claims can be resolved through mediation, arbitration or litigation. It includes an arbitration provision.\\n\\nFor this section, you and us includes any corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related persons or entities. Claim means any current or future claim, dispute or controversy relating to your participation in the program, these Terms & Conditions or any prior program agreement, except for the validity, enforceability or scope of the Arbitration provision. Claim includes but is not limited to:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nInitial claims, counterclaims, crossclaims and third- party claims;\\n\\n2. Claims based upon contract, tort, fraud, statute, regulation, common law and equity;\\n\\n3. Claims by or against any third party using or providing any product, service or benefit in connection with the program; and\\n\\n4. Claims that arise from or relate to (a) the program account or any point balances on the program account, (b) advertisements, promotions or oral or written statements related to the program or any reward or (c) the redemption for and use of any reward. You may not sell, assign or transfer a claim.\\n\\nSending a Claim Notice\\n\\nBefore beginning a lawsuit, mediation or arbitration, you and we agree to send a written notice (a claim notice) to each party against whom a claim is asserted, in order to provide an opportunity to resolve the claim informally or through mediation. Go to americanexpress.com/claim for a sample claim notice. The claim notice must describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded. Notice to you may be provided by your billing statement or sent to your billing address. Notice to us must include your name, address and Account number and be sent to:\\n\\nAmerican Express ADR c/o CT Corporation System, 28 Liberty St NY, NY 10005\\n\\nIf the claim proceeds to arbitration, the amount of any relief demanded in a claim notice will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator rules.\\n\\nMediation\\n\\nIn mediation, a neutral mediator helps parties resolve a claim. The mediator does not decide the claim but helps parties reach agreement.\\n\\nBefore beginning mediation, you or we must first send a claim notice. Within 30 days after sending or receiving a claim notice, you or we may submit the claim to JAMS (1- 800-352-5267, jamsadr.com) or the American Arbitration Association for mediation. We will pay the fees of the mediator.\\n\\n(\\\"AAA\\\")\\n\\n(1-800-778-7879, adr.org)\\n\\nAll mediation-related communications are confidential, inadmissible in court and not subject to discovery. All applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled from the date you or we send the claim notice until termination of the mediation. The submission or failure to submit a claim to mediation will not affect your or our right to elect arbitration.\\n\\nArbitration\\n\\nYou or we may elect to resolve any claim by individual arbitration. Claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator.\\n\\nIf arbitration is chosen by any party, neither you nor we will have the right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim. Further, you and we will not have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration.\",\n          \"Lose Points\\n\\nThis section of the Terms and Conditions contains important details for Products enrolled in the Rewards Program. Sections applicable to you may vary depending on the Products you have.\\n\\n7\\n\\nWhen you return a purchase\\n\\nWhen you return a purchase that you paid for with your enrolled Product, the statement credit you'll receive will cause a corresponding deduction of the points you earned from your Rewards Account.\\n\\nWhen points are awarded on an ineligible purchase\\n\\nIf we determine that points were awarded on an ineligible purchase, we may remove those points from your Rewards Account even if it results in a negative points balance.\\n\\nWhen we cancel your Product\\n\\nIf we cancel any of your Products for any reason (including your death, insolvency or bankruptcy), you'll lose all the points in your Rewards Account.\\n\\nHowever:\\n\\nIf you die, the executor of your estate or personal representative may be able to make a one-time points redemption, depending on your Product, by calling 1-800-AXP-EARN (297-3276).\\n\\nIf we cancel your Card Account due to inactivity, you'll have 90 days to use the points in your Rewards Account before losing them.\\n\\nYou won't lose points if we cancel a Product by accident.\\n\\nWhen you cancel or unenroll your Product\\n\\nWhat happens to the points in your Rewards Account when you cancel or unenroll your Product from the Membership Rewards program depends on whether you keep another Product linked to your Rewards Account.\\n\\nYou will immediately lose all of the points in your Rewards Account if you cancel or unenroll your last linked Product1. However, if your last linked Product is a Corporate Card, you may be able to redeem points for up to 30 days after cancellation or unenrollment.\\n\\n1New York Card Members receive 90 days to use points from notification of account closure by calling the number on the back of their Card. \\\"New York Card Member\\\" means a Card Member with a New York billing address on a linked Card Account.\\n\\nWhen you engage in, or attempt to engage in fraud, abuse, misuse or game the Membership Rewards program\\n\\nIf we determine in our sole judgment that you engaged in\\n\\nfraud, abuse, misuse or gaming in connection with earning or using points or that you may attempt to do so (including, for example and without limitation, manufacturing spend or otherwise generating point earn on ineligible purchases), we may:\\n\\nTemporarily suspend your ability to earn or use points\\n\\nTake away any points in your Rewards Account, even if it results in a negative points balance\\n\\nCancel your Product(s)\\n\\nThe Rewards Program is intended to benefit individuals, whether they have a Product on their own or through their employer. Business and Corporate customers may choose to use points for personal or business reasons, but they can't be directed or required to use them for business. It is also considered fraudulent or abusive for Corporate Card Members to use one Card Account or Rewards Account to accumulate points for company use.\\n\\nIf you feel points were removed in error, please call the number on the back of your Card.\\n\\nWhen you are ineligible to use points on your Corporate Card\\n\\nIf your Corporate Card is the only Card linked to your Rewards Account, and we suspend your ability to make charges with your Card for any reason (including bankruptcy or insolvency of your employer), we'll also suspend your ability to use the points in your Rewards Account1. You can use the points when your ability to make charges with your Card is no longer suspended.\\n\\n1New York Card Members can continue to use points in this scenario for at least 90 days by calling the number on the back of their Card. \\\"New York Card Member\\\" means a Card Member with a New York billing address on a linked Card Account.\\n\\nNegative Points Balance\\n\\nIf you have a negative balance in your Rewards Account, any points you subsequently get will be applied first to reduce the negative balance. You will not be able to use points until your balance becomes positive. The balance in your Rewards Account can be negative if, for example:\",\n          \"1\\n\\nCorporate Cards issued to more than one individual may not be linked to a single Rewards Account.\\n\\nYou agree that:\\n\\nWhen you use points to redeem for rewards, you release American Express and all its affiliates from liability for your use of points, for the reward and how you use it, and for your participation in the Rewards Program.\\n\\nWe and participating retailers aren't responsible for replacing any lost, stolen or damaged certificates, tickets or gift cards.\\n\\nGenerally, you can't use points, and we may cancel your Rewards Account, if your Product is in restricted status, cancelled or past due, or there is a returned payment outstanding1.\\n\\nYou're responsible for learning about and paying any federal, state or local taxes that may apply to earning or using points. Points may be considered taxable income to you and may be reported to the IRS on Form 1099 or Form 1042-S. Please consult your tax advisor if you have questions about the tax treatment of earning or using points.\\n\\nPoints don't belong to you and are not your property. You can't transfer them to someone else's Rewards Account, you can't sell them, and you can't pass them on as part of a legal action, such as a divorce, an inheritance or bankruptcy. \\u2022 The value of points varies according to how you\\n\\nchoose to use them.

When you do, we will charge and credit your Card. We also will deduct points from your Rewards Account, as described above for Pay with Points - except that the points you use must cover the full amount of the fare plus tip.\\n\\nThe points required may vary for future rides. If you don't want to see this Use Points option and your points balance when using your Card in a participating taxi, please call the number on the back of your Card.\\n\\n1If the only Card Product linked to your Rewards Account is a Legacy Card, this redemption option is not available to you.\\n\\n4\\n\\nUse points for gift cards and certificates You can use points to get gift cards and certificates from a variety of merchants. Or you can get American Express Gift Cards to use anywhere American Express is accepted. However, if the only Card Product linked to your Rewards Account is a Legacy Card, you can only use points towards American Express Gift Cards and you cannot use points towards merchant gift cards.\\n\\nBefore using points to get gift cards or certificates, you need to know:\\n\\nGift cards and certificates have no cash value. You can't exchange them for cash or get a cash return for any unused amount (unless the gift card or certificate says otherwise). Each also may have specific terms, conditions or restrictions that apply.\\n\\nRetailers choose whether to accept gift cards and certificates. Most require original cards or certificates; photocopies aren't acceptable.\\n\\nYou may be able to combine cards and certificates you get with points, but they can't be combined with other promotional offers.\\n\\nYou can't use gift cards or certificates to pay for purchases you've already made or in places where gift cards or certificates are illegal. You also can't use gift cards or certificates to pay any existing account balance.\\n\\nGift cards can only be shipped to the U.S. or U.S. territories, excluding Hawaii and Vermont. Further restrictions may be imposed by specific merchants. Since we have no control over merchant programs, you're responsible for understanding all guidelines and restrictions before using points to get gift cards and certificates.\\n\\nYour digital gift card order will appear in your Digital Gift Card Wallet. If one or more of your Products are closed, you may lose access to some or all of your digital gift cards. You must print your digital gift card information prior to the closing of your Product(s) to ensure access to your digital gift cards after Product closure.\\n\\nUseful Tips:\\n\\n1. You can only use points for American Express Gift Cards when you purchase them online. You must have at least 1,000 points in your Rewards Account to get started.\\n\\n2. Most gift cards arrive within 7-10 business days. If you need them sooner, you may be able to choose faster delivery for a fee.\\n\\n3. The funds on an American Express Gift Card don't automatically expire after the Valid Thru date printed on the card. If you still have funds on your gift card after this date, call the customer service number on or with the gift card to get a replacement.\\n\\nUse points to Cover your Card Charges\\n\\nWith Cover your Card Charges, Basic Card Members can use points towards eligible charges. Account Managers and Rewards Managers on a Card Account may also be able to use points towards eligible charges. Corporate Card Members are not eligible for Cover your Card Charges.\\n\\nGenerally, an eligible charge is one that:\\n\\nOccurs in the U.S. or in a U.S. territory \\u2022 Appears in your recent activity online or in your current statement\\n\\nHas never been disputed \\u2022 Is at least $1\\n\\nThe list of eligible charges can change from time to time without notice. We reserve the right to exclude any charge from eligibility for Cover your Card Charges.\",\n          \"11\\n\\nLimitation on Arbitration\\n\\nArbitration Fees and Costs\\n\\nIf the parties agree to resolve a claim by arbitration, that claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to that agreement, and the agreement would not allow claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other Card Members or other persons similarly situated. The arbitrator's authority is limited to claims between you and us alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless you and we agree in writing. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award. Notwithstanding any other provision and without waiving the right to appeal such decision, if any portion of these Limitations on Arbitration provisions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration provision (other than this sentence) will not apply.\\n\\nYou will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in court. We will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees.\\n\\nAt your written request, we will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.\\n\\nAdditional Arbitration Awards\\n\\nIf the arbitrator rules in your favor for an amount greater than any final offer we made before arbitration, the arbitrator's award will include:\\n\\n1. Any money to which you are entitled, but in nocase less than $5,000; and\\n\\nArbitration Procedures\\n\\n2. Any reasonable attorneys' fees, costs andexpert and other witness fees.\\n\\nThis Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, statutes of limitations and privileges. The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery. Subject to the Limitations on Arbitration provisions, the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court. The arbitration will be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your claim.\\n\\nContinuation\\n\\nThis section will survive termination of the program or your participation in it. If any portion of this Claims Resolution section, except as otherwise provided in the Limitations on Arbitration subsection, is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this Claims Resolution section.\\n\\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in person hearing. At any party's request, the arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have 30 days to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing. The organization will appoint a three arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. At your election, arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.\\n\\nQuestions?\\n\\nIf you have questions about anything in these Terms and Conditions, call us at 1-800-AXP-EARN (1-800-297-3276)\\n\\n12\\n\\nCompare Products\\n\\nThe table below shows the American Express products that are eligible to participate in the Rewards Program.

Sections applicable to you may vary depending on the Products you have.\\n\\n7\\n\\nWhen you return a purchase\\n\\nWhen you return a purchase that you paid for with your enrolled Product, the statement credit you'll receive will cause a corresponding deduction of the points you earned from your Rewards Account.\\n\\nWhen points are awarded on an ineligible purchase\\n\\nIf we determine that points were awarded on an ineligible purchase, we may remove those points from your Rewards Account even if it results in a negative points balance.\\n\\nWhen we cancel your Product\\n\\nIf we cancel any of your Products for any reason (including your death, insolvency or bankruptcy), you'll lose all the points in your Rewards Account.\\n\\nHowever:\\n\\nIf you die, the executor of your estate or personal representative may be able to make a one-time points redemption, depending on your Product, by calling 1-800-AXP-EARN (297-3276).\\n\\nIf we cancel your Card Account due to inactivity, you'll have 90 days to use the points in your Rewards Account before losing them.\\n\\nYou won't lose points if we cancel a Product by accident.\\n\\nWhen you cancel or unenroll your Product\\n\\nWhat happens to the points in your Rewards Account when you cancel or unenroll your Product from the Membership Rewards program depends on whether you keep another Product linked to your Rewards Account.\\n\\nYou will immediately lose all of the points in your Rewards Account if you cancel or unenroll your last linked Product1. However, if your last linked Product is a Corporate Card, you may be able to redeem points for up to 30 days after cancellation or unenrollment.\\n\\n1New York Card Members receive 90 days to use points from notification of account closure by calling the number on the back of their Card. \\\"New York Card Member\\\" means a Card Member with a New York billing address on a linked Card Account.\\n\\nWhen you engage in, or attempt to engage in fraud, abuse, misuse or game the Membership Rewards program\\n\\nIf we determine in our sole judgment that you engaged in\\n\\nfraud, abuse, misuse or gaming in connection with earning or using points or that you may attempt to do so (including, for example and without limitation, manufacturing spend or otherwise generating point earn on ineligible purchases), we may:\\n\\nTemporarily suspend your ability to earn or use points\\n\\nTake away any points in your Rewards Account, even if it results in a negative points balance\\n\\nCancel your Product(s)\\n\\nThe Rewards Program is intended to benefit individuals, whether they have a Product on their own or through their employer. Business and Corporate customers may choose to use points for personal or business reasons, but they can't be directed or required to use them for business. It is also considered fraudulent or abusive for Corporate Card Members to use one Card Account or Rewards Account to accumulate points for company use.\\n\\nIf you feel points were removed in error, please call the number on the back of your Card.\\n\\nWhen you are ineligible to use points on your Corporate Card\\n\\nIf your Corporate Card is the only Card linked to your Rewards Account, and we suspend your ability to make charges with your Card for any reason (including bankruptcy or insolvency of your employer), we'll also suspend your ability to use the points in your Rewards Account1. You can use the points when your ability to make charges with your Card is no longer suspended.\\n\\n1New York Card Members can continue to use points in this scenario for at least 90 days by calling the number on the back of their Card. \\\"New York Card Member\\\" means a Card Member with a New York billing address on a linked Card Account.\\n\\nNegative Points Balance\\n\\nIf you have a negative balance in your Rewards Account, any points you subsequently get will be applied first to reduce the negative balance. You will not be able to use points until your balance becomes positive.
