The arbitrator's authority is limited to claims between you and us alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless you and we agree in writing. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award. Notwithstanding any other provision and without waiving the right to appeal such decision, if any portion of these Limitations on Arbitration provisions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration provision (other than this sentence) will not apply.\\n\\nYou will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in court. We will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees.\\n\\nAt your written request, we will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.\\n\\nAdditional Arbitration Awards\\n\\nIf the arbitrator rules in your favor for an amount greater than any final offer we made before arbitration, the arbitrator's award will include:\\n\\n1. Any money to which you are entitled, but in nocase less than $5,000; and\\n\\nArbitration Procedures\\n\\n2. Any reasonable attorneys' fees, costs andexpert and other witness fees.\\n\\nThis Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, statutes of limitations and privileges. The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery. Subject to the Limitations on Arbitration provisions, the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court. The arbitration will be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your claim.\\n\\nContinuation\\n\\nThis section will survive termination of the program or your participation in it. If any portion of this Claims Resolution section, except as otherwise provided in the Limitations on Arbitration subsection, is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this Claims Resolution section.\\n\\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in person hearing. At any party's request, the arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have 30 days to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing. The organization will appoint a three arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. At your election, arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.\\n\\nQuestions?\\n\\nIf you have questions about anything in these Terms and Conditions, call us at 1-800-AXP-EARN (1-800-297-3276)\\n\\n12\\n\\nCompare Products\\n\\nThe table below shows the American Express products that are eligible to participate in the Rewards Program.

Points may be considered taxable income to you and may be reported to the IRS on Form 1099 or Form 1042-S. Please consult your tax advisor if you have questions about the tax treatment of earning or using points.\\n\\nPoints don't belong to you and are not your property. You can't transfer them to someone else's Rewards Account, you can't sell them, and you can't pass them on as part of a legal action, such as a divorce, an inheritance or bankruptcy. \\u2022 The value of points varies according to how you\\n\\nchoose to use them.

We may remove points from your Rewards Account if we determine that those points were earned on ineligible purchases. You earn points for eligible purchases only if we receive timely payment of the minimum amount due on your Card Account billing statement. If your Card Account is a Consumer Card Account or a Business Card Account, you must pay the amount due on your billing statement so that we receive your payment by the Payment Due Date shown on that billing statement. If your Card Account is a Corporate Card account, you must pay the amount due on your Card Account statement so that we receive your payment by the Closing Date of the next billing period.\",\n          \"The points you got for a purchase are reversed because you returned the purchase and you do not have enough points in your Rewards Account to cover the reversal; or\\n\\nWe determine that you are ineligible to get a points incentive award and you do not have enough points in your Rewards Account to cover the reversal of that award. 8\\n\\nArbitration\\n\\nClaims Resolution\\n\\nMost customer concerns can be resolved by calling our Customer Service Department at the number listed on the back of your Card. In the event Customer Service is unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, this section explains how claims can be resolved through mediation, arbitration or litigation. It includes an arbitration provision.\\n\\nFor this section, you and us includes any corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related persons or entities. Claim means any current or future claim, dispute or controversy relating to your participation in the program, these Terms & Conditions or any prior program agreement, except for the validity, enforceability or scope of the Arbitration provision. Claim includes but is not limited to:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nInitial claims, counterclaims, crossclaims and third- party claims;\\n\\n2. Claims based upon contract, tort, fraud, statute, regulation, common law and equity;\\n\\n3. Claims by or against any third party using or providing any product, service or benefit in connection with the program; and\\n\\n4. Claims that arise from or relate to (a) the program account or any point balances on the program account, (b) advertisements, promotions or oral or written statements related to the program or any reward or (c) the redemption for and use of any reward. You may not sell, assign or transfer a claim.\\n\\nSending a Claim Notice\\n\\nBefore beginning a lawsuit, mediation or arbitration, you and we agree to send a written notice (a claim notice) to each party against whom a claim is asserted, in order to provide an opportunity to resolve the claim informally or through mediation. Go to americanexpress.com/claim for a sample claim notice. The claim notice must describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded. Notice to you may be provided by your billing statement or sent to your billing address. Notice to us must include your name, address and Account number and be sent to:\\n\\nAmerican Express ADR c/o CT Corporation System, 28 Liberty St NY, NY 10005\\n\\nIf the claim proceeds to arbitration, the amount of any relief demanded in a claim notice will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator rules.\\n\\nMediation\\n\\nIn mediation, a neutral mediator helps parties resolve a claim. The mediator does not decide the claim but helps parties reach agreement.\\n\\nBefore beginning mediation, you or we must first send a claim notice. Within 30 days after sending or receiving a claim notice, you or we may submit the claim to JAMS (1- 800-352-5267, jamsadr.com) or the American Arbitration Association for mediation. We will pay the fees of the mediator.\\n\\n(\\\"AAA\\\")\\n\\n(1-800-778-7879, adr.org)\\n\\nAll mediation-related communications are confidential, inadmissible in court and not subject to discovery. All applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled from the date you or we send the claim notice until termination of the mediation. The submission or failure to submit a claim to mediation will not affect your or our right to elect arbitration.\\n\\nArbitration\\n\\nYou or we may elect to resolve any claim by individual arbitration. Claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator.\\n\\nIf arbitration is chosen by any party, neither you nor we will have the right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim.

The arbitrator's authority is limited to claims between you and us alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless you and we agree in writing. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award. Notwithstanding any other provision and without waiving the right to appeal such decision, if any portion of these Limitations on Arbitration provisions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration provision (other than this sentence) will not apply.\\n\\nYou will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in court. We will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees.\\n\\nAt your written request, we will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.\\n\\nAdditional Arbitration Awards\\n\\nIf the arbitrator rules in your favor for an amount greater than any final offer we made before arbitration, the arbitrator's award will include:\\n\\n1. Any money to which you are entitled, but in nocase less than $5,000; and\\n\\nArbitration Procedures\\n\\n2. Any reasonable attorneys' fees, costs andexpert and other witness fees.\\n\\nThis Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, statutes of limitations and privileges. The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery. Subject to the Limitations on Arbitration provisions, the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court. The arbitration will be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your claim.\\n\\nContinuation\\n\\nThis section will survive termination of the program or your participation in it. If any portion of this Claims Resolution section, except as otherwise provided in the Limitations on Arbitration subsection, is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this Claims Resolution section.\\n\\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in person hearing. At any party's request, the arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA; however, any party will have 30 days to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing. The organization will appoint a three arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. At your election, arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.\\n\\nQuestions?\\n\\nIf you have questions about anything in these Terms and Conditions, call us at 1-800-AXP-EARN (1-800-297-3276)\\n\\n12\\n\\nCompare Products\\n\\nThe table below shows the American Express products that are eligible to participate in the Rewards Program.

You are not required to resolve your claim through mediation or arbitration. You may decline our request to resolve a claim through mediation or arbitration. You may elect to resolve your claim through litigation.\\n\\nMediation\\n\\nIf you elect to resolve your claim through mediation, a neutral mediator will help resolve the claim. The mediator does not decide the claim but helps parties reach agreement. Before beginning mediation, you or we must first send a claim notice. Within 30 days after sending or receiving a claim notice, you or we may submit the claim to JAMS (1-800-352-5267, jamsadr.com) or the American Arbitration Association (\\\"AAA\\\") (1-800-778-7879, adr.org)\\n\\nfor mediation. We will pay the fees of the mediator. All mediation-related communications are confidential, inadmissible in court and not subject to discovery. All applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled until termination of the mediation. Either you or we may terminate the mediation at any time. The submission or failure to submit a claim to mediation will not affect your or our right to elect litigation or arbitration. The outcome of mediation proceedings is non-binding. You may proceed to litigation or arbitration regardless of the outcome of mediation.\\n\\nArbitration\\n\\nYou may elect, but are not required, to resolve any claim by individual arbitration. We may also request to resolve any claim by individual arbitration, but you are not required to accept our request. Claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator.\\n\\nIf you elect or agree to resolve a claim through arbitration, your or our right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim may be limited. Further, you and we may not have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is more limited. The arbitrator's decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. Except as set forth below, the arbitrator's decision will be final and binding. Other rights you or we would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.\\n\\nInitiating Arbitration\\n\\nIf you and we agree to proceed to arbitration, claims will be referred to either JAMS or AAA, as selected by the party electing arbitration. Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration provision and the selected organization's rules in effect when the claim is filed, except where those rules conflict with these Terms & Conditions. If we choose the organization, you may select the other within 30 days after receiving notice of our selection. Contact JAMS or AAA to begin an arbitration or for other information. Claims also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and we agree in writing or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA). We will not request arbitration for any claim you file in small claims court, so long as the claim is individual and pending only in that court. You may otherwise elect to arbitrate any claim at any time unless it has been filed in court and trial has begun or final judgment has been entered.\\n\\n11\\n\\nLimitation on Arbitration\\n\\nArbitration Fees and Costs\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"focus_area\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"earning points\",\n          \"account management\",\n          \"promotion and bonuses\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sub_focus_area\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 22,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"promotional earning opportunities\",\n          \"restrictions and limitations\",\n          \"fee structure and charges\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target_audience\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"novice\",\n          \"intermediate\",\n          \"expert\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"qa_pair\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{\\\"question\\\": \\\"How many categories can I choose from to earn additional points with the Business Gold Rewards Card?\\\", \\\"answer\\\": \\\"You can choose from 5 categories to earn additional points with the Business Gold Rewards Card: airfares, advertising, gasoline, shipping services, and one other category of your choice.\\\", \\\"reasoning\\\": \\\"This Q&A pair is valuable because it helps novice cardholders understand the points earning structure for business purchases, which is a key aspect of account management and points tracking.\\\"}\",\n          \"{\\\"question\\\": \\\"What options do you have for resolving a claim under this program?\\\", \\\"answer\\\": \\\"You have the option to resolve a claim through mediation, arbitration, or litigation.
